Grammar Interpreter (Actually Two Uses or Instances of a Word)

Note: The List Prolog Interpreter at https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter/tree/master now has a more powerful grammars feature than this algorithm.

This Prolog program contains a Grammar Interpreter without DCGs.  It uses it to find two uses (instances) of a word in the sentences, using the grammar (both given as input).
